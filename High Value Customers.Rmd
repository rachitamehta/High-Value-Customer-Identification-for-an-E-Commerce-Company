View(Ecommerce)
```
```{r}

```
```{r}
# one of the requirements for the clustering algorithms to work is to have a dataset without any missing values
# Checking for any missing values in the data. Also found in the summary(Ecommerce) function
sum(is.na(Ecommerce$CustomerID))
```
```{r}
# There are 135,080 missing values for customerId.
# Omitting the missing customerIds from the data
ecomm <- na.omit(ecommerce)
summary(ecomm)
# No missing values in the customerId column
```
```{r}
sum(is.na(ecomm$CustomerID))
# No missing values in the data
```
```{r}
View(ecomm)
# There are multiple same customerIds in the data
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```
```{r}
# creating a column for revenue = Quantity * UnitPrice
# Revenue column will help us to understand the amount of revenue generated by the customers
ecomm$revenue = with(ecomm, Quantity * UnitPrice)
